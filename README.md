# AntiDrainGangMod
This is a legit pvp mod for Minecraft 1.16, I am making it as a personal project however am I making it open source because why not.

This isn't really meant to replace Lunar or whatever I am doing it to teach myself more about rendering.

It is a fabric mod, you need to install fabric, fabric api, and then put this jar in your mods folder.

Huge thanks to [moomooooo](https://github.com/moomooooo) for [bedroom](https://github.com/beach-house-development/bedroom) which this client is based off of.  

Cheers!
